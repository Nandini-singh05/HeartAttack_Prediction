# HeartAttack_Prediction
<p>Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. Early detection of heart attack risk can help in preventing life-threatening complications. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the risk of heart attack by analyzing a large dataset of patient records.
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack for a given patient based on various risk factors such as age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar level, and other medical conditions.<p>
